# Azure Reference Platform

This repository contains a reference Azure Platform Configuration for
[Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/). It's a great starting point for building
internal cloud platforms with Azure and offer a self-service API to your internal
development teams.

This platform offers APIs for setting up fully configured AKS clusters
with secure networking, stateful cloud services (Database) that can securely
connect to the AKS clusters, an Observability Stack, and a GitOps
System. All these components are built using cloud service tools from
the [Official Upbound Family Azure Provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-family-azure).
App deployments can securely connect to the infrastructure they need using secrets
distributed directly to the app namespace.

## Overview

This reference platform outlines a specialized API for generating an AKS cluster
([XCluster](apis/cluster/definition.yaml)) that incorporates XRs from the specified configurations:

* [upbound-configuration-app](https://github.com/upbound/configuration-app)
* [upbound-configuration-azure-database](https://github.com/upbound/configuration-azure-database)
* [upbound-configuration-azure-aks](https://github.com/upbound/configuration-azure-aks)
* [upbound-configuration-azure-network](https://github.com/upbound/configuration-azure-network)
* [upbound-configuration-gitops-flux](https://github.com/upbound/configuration-gitops-flux)
* [upbound-configuration-observability-oss](https://github.com/upbound/configuration-observability-oss)

## Quickstart

### Pre-Requisites

Before we can install the reference platform we want to install the `up` CLI.
This is a utility that makes following this quickstart guide easier. Everything
described here can also be done in a declarative approach which we highly
recommend for any production type use-case.
<!-- TODO enhance this guide: Getting ready for Gitops -->

To install `up` run this install script:
```console
curl -sL https://cli.upbound.io | sh
```
See [up docs](https://docs.upbound.io/cli/) for more install options.

We need a running Crossplane control plane to install our instance. We are
using [Universal Crossplane (UXP)](https://github.com/upbound/universal-crossplane).
Ensure that your kubectl context points to the correct Kubernetes cluster or
create a new [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) cluster:

```console
kind create cluster
```

Finally install UXP into the `upbound-system` namespace:

```console
up uxp install
```

You can validate the install by inspecting all installed components:

```console
kubectl get all -n upbound-system
```

### Install the Azure Reference Platform

Now you can install this reference platform. It's packaged as a [Crossplane
configuration package](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/packages/)
so there is a single command to install it:

```console
up ctp configuration install xpkg.upbound.io/upbound/platform-ref-azure:v0.8.0
```

Validate the install by inspecting the provider and configuration packages:
```console
kubectl get providers,providerrevision

kubectl get configurations,configurationrevisions
```

Check the
[marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io/configurations/upbound/platform-ref-azure/)
for the latest version of this platform.

### Configure the Azure provider

Before we can use the reference platform we need to configure it with Azure
credentials:

```console
# Create a azure.json file with the azure cli:
# Replace <Subscription ID> with your subscription ID.
az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth --role Owner --scopes /subscriptions/<Subscription ID> \
  > azure.json

# Create a K8s secret with the Azure creds:
kubectl create secret generic azure-creds -n upbound-system --from-file=credentials=./azure.json

# Configure the Azure Provider to use the secret:
kubectl apply -f examples/azure-default-provider.yaml
```

See [provider-azure docs](https://docs.upbound.io/providers/provider-azure/authentication/) for more detailed configuration options

## Using the Azure reference platform

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations. You have just installed your first Crossplane powered
platform!

Application developers can now use the platform to request resources which than
will provisioned in Azure. This would usually done by bundling a claim as part of
the application code. In our example here we simply create the claims directly:

Create a custom defined cluster:
```console
kubectl apply -f examples/cluster-claim.yaml
```

Create a custom defined database:
```console
kubectl apply -f examples/postgres-claim.yaml
```

Now deploy the sample application:

```
kubectl apply -f examples/app-claim.yaml
```

You can verify status by inspecting the claims, composites and managed
resources:

```console
kubectl get claim,composite,managed
```

To delete the provisioned resources you would simply delete the claims again:

```console
kubectl delete -f examples/cluster-claim.yaml,examples/postgres-claim.yaml,examples/app-claim.yaml
```

To uninstall the provider & platform configuration:

```console
kubectl delete configurations.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-platform-ref-azure
kubectl delete configurations.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-configuration-app
kubectl delete configurations.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-configuration-azure-database
kubectl delete configurations.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-configuration-azure-aks
kubectl delete configurations.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-configuration-azure-network
kubectl delete configurations.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-configuration-gitops-flux
kubectl delete configurations.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-configuration-observability-oss

kubectl delete providers.pkg.crossplane.io crossplane-contrib-provider-helm
kubectl delete providers.pkg.crossplane.io crossplane-contrib-provider-kubernetes
kubectl delete providers.pkg.crossplane.io grafana-provider-grafana
kubectl delete providers.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-provider-azure-containerservice
kubectl delete providers.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-provider-azure-dbformariadb
kubectl delete providers.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-provider-azure-dbforpostgresql
kubectl delete providers.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-provider-azure-network
kubectl delete providers.pkg.crossplane.io upbound-provider-family-azure
```

## Customize for your Organization

So far we have used the existing reference platform but haven't made any
changes.

For the following examples we are using `my-org` and `my-platform`:

```console
ORG=my-org
PLATFORM=my-platform
```

### Pre-Requisites
First you need to create a [free Upbound
account](https://accounts.upbound.io/register) to push your custom platform.
Afterwards you can log in:

```console
up login --username=$ORG
```

### Make the changes

To make your changes clone this repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/upbound/platform-ref-azure.git $PLATFORM && cd $PLATFORM
```

### Build and push your platform

To share your new platform you need to build and distribute this package.

To build the package use the `up xpkg build` command:

```console
up xpkg build --name package.xpkg --package-root=package --examples-root=examples
```

Afterwards you can it to the marketplace. Don't worry it's private to you.

```console
TAG=v0.1.0
up repo create ${PLATFORM}
up xpkg push ${ORG}/${PLATFORM}:${TAG} -f package/package.xpkg
```

You can now see your listing in the marketplace:
```console
open https://marketplace.upbound.io/configurations/${ORG}/${PLATFORM}/${TAG}
```

## Using your custom platform

Now if you want to use it you can follow the steps from above. The only
difference is that you need to specify a package-pull-secret as the package is
currently private:

```console
up ctp pull-secret create personal-pull-secret
```

```console
up ctp configuration install xpkg.upbound.io/${ORG}/${PLATFORM}:${TAG} --package-pull-secrets=personal-pull-secret
```

For alternative declarative installation approach see the [example Configuration
manifest](examples/configuration.yaml). Please update to your org, platform and
tag before applying.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations. You have just build and installed your first custom
Crossplane powered platform!
